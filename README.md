The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate a
numerical outcome based on a dataset with relevant features. Linear regression is a
fundamental machine learning algorithm, and this project provides hands-on experience in
developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model.

Key Concepts and Challenges:

Data Collection: Obtain a dataset with numerical features and a target variable for
prediction.
Data Exploration and Cleaning: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, handle
missing values, and ensure data quality.
Feature Selection: Identify relevant features that may contribute to the predictive model.
Model Training: Implement linear regression using a machine learning library (e.g., Scikit-
Learn).
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset using
metrics such as Mean Squared Error or R-squared.
Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate the relationship between the predicted and
actual values.

House price prediction using linear regression involves developing a model to estimate the price of a house based on various features like size, number of 
bedrooms, location, etc. The process includes collecting and preprocessing data, selecting relevant features, splitting the dataset into training and testing 
sets, building and training a linear regression model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions. The model learns the linear relationship between 
the input features and the target variable (house price) and can be deployed for predicting house prices in real-world scenarios.
